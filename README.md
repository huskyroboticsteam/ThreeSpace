# ThreeSpace sensor library

This is the C++ library to access the Yost Labs 3-Space IMU sensor.

The original library was made available from Yost Labs as a zip file
containing the source code and documentation; this repository is just
to provide a better method for downloading it and provide some build
system files for compiling it.

## Installation
Installation will be documented later once build system files are in
place.

## Usage/Documentation
The original zip file contained Doxygen documentation; this will be
added later once we have a good system for keeping track of it and/or
regenerating it.

## Licensing/Legal Information

Husky Robotics, 2021.
